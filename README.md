# Flux Feed - Twitter Clone

Flux Feed is a modern Twitter clone application that offers a full-featured social media experience. Developed with the MERN stack, it enables real-time interactions, secure authentication, and a clean, responsive interface with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. This project highlights my full-stack development skills, with an emphasis on performance, scalability, and intuitive design.

## Features

## 1. Real-Time User Interactions
Users on Flux Feed experience real-time interactions, making the app dynamic and engaging.
