# Flux Feed - Twitter Clone

Flux Feed is a modern Twitter clone application that offers a full-featured social media experience. Developed with the MERN stack, it enables real-time interactions, secure authentication, and a clean, responsive interface with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. This project highlights my full-stack development skills, with an emphasis on performance, scalability, and intuitive design.

## Features

## 1. Real-Time User Interactions
Users on Flux Feed experience real-time interactions, making the app dynamic and engaging.

- Posting and Liking: Users can post new tweets and like others' tweets, with updates happening in real-time.
- Retweeting and Commenting: Users can retweet and comment on posts instantly, enabling a truly interactive experience.
- Notification System: Real-time notifications for new followers, likes, retweets, and comments without refreshing the page.

## 2. Secure User Authentication
Flux Feed uses secure authentication methods to ensure user data privacy and session security.

- JWT Authentication: Users sign in with JSON Web Tokens, which keep sessions secure and prevent unauthorized access.
- Bcrypt Password Hashing: User passwords are encrypted with bcrypt, providing an extra layer of security.

## 3. Modern, Responsive Interface
Flux Feed is designed with a clean, mobile-friendly interface for a great user experience on any device.

- Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI: The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, making use of utility classes and modern UI components.
